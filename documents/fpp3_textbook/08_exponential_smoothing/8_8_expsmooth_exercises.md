- Write your own function to implement simple exponential smoothing. The function should take argumentsy(the time series),alpha(the smoothing parameter\(\alpha\)) andlevel(the initial level\(\ell_0\)). It should return the forecast of the next observation in the series. Does it give the same forecast asETS()?

- Forecast the Chinese GDP from theglobal_economydata set using an ETS model. Experiment with the various options in theETS()function to see how much the forecasts change with damped trend, or with a Box-Cox transformation. Try to develop an intuition of what each is doing to the forecasts.[Hint: use a relatively large value ofhwhen forecasting, so you can clearly see the differences between the various options when plotting the forecasts.]
