- Download the filetute1.csvfromthe book website, open it in Excel (or some other spreadsheet application), and review its contents. You should find four columns of information. Columns B through D each contain a quarterly series, labelled Sales, AdBudget and GDP. Sales contains the quarterly sales for a small company over the period 1981-2005. AdBudget is the advertising budget and GDP is the gross domestic product. All series have been adjusted for inflation.You can read the data into R with the following script:tute1<-readr::read_csv("tute1.csv")View(tute1)Convert the data to time seriesmytimeseries<-tute1|>mutate(Quarter =yearquarter(Quarter))|>as_tsibble(index =Quarter)Construct time series plots of each of the three seriesmytimeseries|>pivot_longer(-Quarter)|>ggplot(aes(x =Quarter,y =value,colour =name))+geom_line()+facet_grid(name~.,scales ="free_y")Check what happens when you don’t includefacet_grid().

You can read the data into R with the following script:


```
tute1 <- readr::read_csv("tute1.csv")
View(tute1)
```

- Convert the data to time seriesmytimeseries<-tute1|>mutate(Quarter =yearquarter(Quarter))|>as_tsibble(index =Quarter)

Convert the data to time series


```
mytimeseries <- tute1 |>
  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Quarter)) |>
  as_tsibble(index = Quarter)
```

- Construct time series plots of each of the three seriesmytimeseries|>pivot_longer(-Quarter)|>ggplot(aes(x =Quarter,y =value,colour =name))+geom_line()+facet_grid(name~.,scales ="free_y")Check what happens when you don’t includefacet_grid().

Construct time series plots of each of the three series


```
mytimeseries |>
  pivot_longer(-Quarter) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = value, colour = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(name ~ ., scales = "free_y")
```

- Theaus_livestockdata contains the monthly total number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria, Australia, from Jul 1972 to Dec 2018. Usefilter()to extract pig slaughters in Victoria between 1990 and 1995. Useautoplot()andACF()for this data. How do they differ from white noise? If a longer period of data is used, what difference does it make to the ACF?
