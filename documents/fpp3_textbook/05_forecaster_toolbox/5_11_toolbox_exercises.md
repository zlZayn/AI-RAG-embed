- Apply a seasonal naïve method to the quarterly Australian beer production data from 1992. Check if the residuals look like white noise, and plot the forecasts. The following code will help.# Extract data of interestrecent_production<-aus_production|>filter(year(Quarter)>=1992)# Define and estimate a modelfit<-recent_production|>model(SNAIVE(Beer))# Look at the residualsfit|>gg_tsresiduals()# Look a some forecastsfit|>forecast()|>autoplot(recent_production)What do you conclude?

Apply a seasonal naïve method to the quarterly Australian beer production data from 1992. Check if the residuals look like white noise, and plot the forecasts. The following code will help.


```
# Extract data of interest
recent_production <- aus_production |>
  filter(year(Quarter) >= 1992)
# Define and estimate a model
fit <- recent_production |> model(SNAIVE(Beer))
# Look at the residuals
fit |> gg_tsresiduals()
# Look a some forecasts
fit |> forecast() |> autoplot(recent_production)
```

- Are the following statements true or false? Explain your answer.Good forecast methods should have normally distributed residuals.A model with small residuals will give good forecasts.The best measure of forecast accuracy is MAPE.If your model doesn’t forecast well, you should make it more complicated.Always choose the model with the best forecast accuracy as measured on the test set.

For your retail time series (from Exercise 7 in Section2.10):

- Create a training dataset consisting of observations before 2011 usingmyseries_train<-myseries|>filter(year(Month)<2011)

Create a training dataset consisting of observations before 2011 using


```
myseries_train <- myseries |>
  filter(year(Month) < 2011)
```

- Check that your data have been split appropriately by producing the following plot.autoplot(myseries, Turnover)+autolayer(myseries_train, Turnover,colour ="red")

Check that your data have been split appropriately by producing the following plot.


```
autoplot(myseries, Turnover) +
  autolayer(myseries_train, Turnover, colour = "red")
```

- Fit a seasonal naïve model usingSNAIVE()applied to your training data (myseries_train).fit<-myseries_train|>model(SNAIVE())

Fit a seasonal naïve model usingSNAIVE()applied to your training data (myseries_train).


```
fit <- myseries_train |>
  model(SNAIVE())
```

- Check the residuals.fit|>gg_tsresiduals()Do the residuals appear to be uncorrelated and normally distributed?

Check the residuals.


```
fit |> gg_tsresiduals()
```


Do the residuals appear to be uncorrelated and normally distributed?

- Produce forecasts for the test datafc<-fit|>forecast(new_data =anti_join(myseries, myseries_train))fc|>autoplot(myseries)

Produce forecasts for the test data


```
fc <- fit |>
  forecast(new_data = anti_join(myseries, myseries_train))
fc |> autoplot(myseries)
```

- Compare the accuracy of your forecasts against the actual values.fit|>accuracy()fc|>accuracy(myseries)

Compare the accuracy of your forecasts against the actual values.


```
fit |> accuracy()
fc |> accuracy(myseries)
```

- Consider the number of pigs slaughtered in New South Wales (data setaus_livestock).Produce some plots of the data in order to become familiar with it.Create a training set of 486 observations, withholding a test set of 72 observations (6 years).Try using various benchmark methods to forecast the training set and compare the results on the test set. Which method did best?Check the residuals of your preferred method. Do they resemble white noise?
